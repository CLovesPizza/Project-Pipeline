# Project-Pipeline
A plug and play, on the fly water meter for water conservation.

# Description
Project pipeline is similar to the kill a Watt meter, however for water consumption. The device is small and can be attached with a standard 1/2" water hose or pipe connector. The device is meant to monitor the amount of water being used over a short length of time, for instance over the course of a single shower, or to see how much water is being used while watering a garden.

# Hackaday Prize
This project is an entry in the 2016 Hackaday Prize to solve the problem of water over-consumption.
